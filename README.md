# Codewars

Codewars is a platform that helps you learn, train, and improve your coding skills by solving programming tasks of many types and difficulty levels.

Ranks are used to indicate the proficiency of users and the difficulty of Kata. By increasing order of proficiency/difficulty:

- From 8 Kyu to 1 Kyu

These are my solutions to codewars code katas. 

Codewarriors are strongly encouraged not to look at my solutions to Kata until they have completed it themselves or at least took the time to think about their own approaches.
